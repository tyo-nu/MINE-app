        <p>There are many ways you can use this website but we have developed a few tours that show the basics.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a style="font-size: 12pt" ng-click="startGeneralTour()" analytics-on analytics-category="Tour">General Website Tour</a></li>
            <li><a style="font-size: 12pt" ng-click="startMetabolomicsTour()" analytics-on analytics-category="Tour">Metabolomics Tour</a></li>
        </ul>

    <h4>How do you generate <i>in silico</i> metabolites?</h4>
    <div class="well">
        These compounds are generated from hand-curated reaction rules generalized form chemistry according to the Enzyme
        Commission classification system. For more information please refer to
        <a href="http://www.jcheminf.com/content/7/1/44">the original MINE publication</a>
    </div>

    <h4>How can I integrate your database into my tool/pipeline?</h4>
    <div class="well">
        We offer API clients in JavaScript, Python and Perl which cover all the functionality of this website. These
        clients are available at <a href="https://github.com/JamesJeffryes/MINE-API" analytics-on analytics-category="Link Out"> GitHub.</a> You may also
        <a ui-sref="download"> download SDF files </a> of the generated
        metabolites in the database. Due to licencing restrictions, we are not able to redistribute the original
        database compounds (i.e. KEGG COMPOUND) but these compounds are available from the original sources.

    <h4>I found an error/ I'm skeptical about the validity of a compound</h4>
    <div class="well">
        We would love to hear about it. Please let us know by using our
