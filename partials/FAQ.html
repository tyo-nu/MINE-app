    <h4>How do you generate <i>in silico</i> metabolites?</h4>
    <div class="well">
        These compounds are generated from <a
            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717621000288">automatically generated reaction
            rules</a> from known biochemistry
        on MetaCyc. For more information please refer to
        <a href="http://www.jcheminf.com/content/7/1/44">the original MINE publication.</a>
    </div>

    <h4>How can I integrate your database into my tool/pipeline?</h4>
    <div class="well">
        We offer a <a href="https://mine-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">REST API</a> in python which covers all the
        functionality of this website (and more). These
        clients are available at <a href="https://github.com/tyo-nu/MINE-Server" analytics-on
            analytics-category="Link Out"> GitHub.</a> For example, you could use the REST API to download all MINE
        compounds.

    <h4>I found an error/I'm skeptical about the validity of a compound</h4>
    <div class="well">
        We would love to hear about it. Please let us know by using our
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1B0OqkL8Fc16-V-t71fMDpVoMp98O_LwgeOcJa7NRmFI/viewform"> bug reporting
            form.</a>
